# Bike-Share-London-Analysis
I've conducted an analysis of a bike sharing dataset to extract valuable insights and answer various questions related to the data. Here's a summary of the key findings:

**Data Exploration:** I started by importing necessary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. After loading the dataset, I renamed the columns to make them more descriptive.

**Data Summary:** The dataset contains information on bike shares in London, including factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather code, and more. It comprises 8,699 rows of data.

**Seasonal Analysis:** I grouped the data by season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter) to analyze how bike shares vary across different seasons. Here are some of the insights:

Spring had an average hourly bike share count of approximately 1,107, translating to around 26,576 daily bike shares.
Summer had the highest average hourly bike share count at around 1,481, which is approximately 35,536 daily bike shares.
Autumn had an average hourly bike share count of approximately 1,230, equivalent to around 29,518 daily bike shares.
Winter had the lowest average hourly bike share count at approximately 840, which is roughly 20,154 daily bike shares.
**Weather Impact:** I also investigated the relationship between weather conditions and bike shares. For instance, I found that the highest bike share counts occurred during the hottest weather, specifically on September 13th, 2016, when the temperature reached 33.0Â°C. During this time, the bike share count was 1,820.

**Extreme Conditions:** I identified the lowest bike share counts during extreme weather conditions. For example, the dataset recorded the lowest bike share counts during winter, with a minimum of 12 bike shares during several hours.

**Wind Speed Analysis:** I found that the highest recorded wind speed in the dataset was 56.0, which coincided with a bike share count of 556. High wind speeds appear to have a negative impact on bike shares.

**Data Visualization:** To better understand the relationships between variables, I created scatter plots, such as one showing the correlation between bike shares and temperature. I also generated a pie chart to visualize the distribution of bike shares across different seasons.

In conclusion, this analysis provides valuable insights into the London bike sharing dataset. It demonstrates how various factors, including weather conditions and seasons, impact bike shares. These findings can be used to optimize bike sharing services and make data-driven decisions to meet user demand effectively.
